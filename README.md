# TravelEase — Static UI (Download)

This is a static, responsive **Tour & Travel** UI built with Tailwind CSS (via CDN) and minimal JavaScript.

## What you get
- `index.html` — Landing page (search card, top destinations, chat toggle)
- `packages.html` — Package listing UI
- `package-details.html` — Package detail page
- `dashboard.html` — User dashboard mock
- `admin.html` — Admin dashboard mock
- `assets/logo.svg` — Simple logo
- `styles.css` & `app.js` — Minimal custom styles and JS (chat toggle + theme)

## How to run
1. Unzip the archive.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser (no server required).
3. To integrate into Angular/React, copy the HTML/CSS/JS into components as needed.

## Notes
- Chat UI is a mock — integrate with OpenAI or your backend for real chat.
- Payment flows are placeholders — integrate Stripe/Razorpay on booking actions.
